                <strong>Product Details</strong>
                Foodie Card costs $29.99 a year and provides members with 10% off their bill at tons of incredible restaurants. Also, Foodie Card members have access to special member-only events. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>What is the 'Buy A Card, Give A Meal' program?</strong>
                For every Foodie Card purchased, we donate an entire day of meals to somebody in need. To date, we’ve donated close to 20,000 meals.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Any Restrictions?</strong>
                Foodie Card can only be applied to dine-in bills, drinks included. If a restaurant allows Foodie Card to be applied to take-out or delivery, that’s a special benefit that is unrelated to the guidelines of Foodie Card. Participating restaurants reserve the right to refuse Foodie Card on the following holidays: Christmas Eve, Easter, Father’s Day, Mother’s Day, New Year’s Eve, Thanksgiving Eve, and Valentines Day. There is a maximum discount of $100 per bill. Foodie Card cannot be combined with other coupons or specials.
