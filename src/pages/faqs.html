                    <p>
                        Very similar to the expiration question above. Foodie Card prides itself on transparency which is why we notify the customer a week before and again 24 hours before the actual renewal charge of $29.99 (plus tax). Please know that we do not automatically renew – we email twice before a renewal should occur, and all that needs to happen to cancel a renewal is an email to <a href="mailto:hello@foodiecard.com">hello@foodiecard.com</a>. As always, we donate a full day of meals to those less fortunate through our partnership with Island Harvest.
