            <p>
                Foodie Card prides itself on transparency which is why we notify the customer a week before and again 24 hours before the actual renewal charge of $29.99 (plus tax).  Please know we email twice before a renewal should occur, and all thatâ€™s required to cancel a renewal is an email to <a href="mailto:hello@foodiecard.com">hello@foodiecard.com</a> or call us toll-free.
